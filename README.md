# Bleeter ETL

Everybody's favourite social media app, Bleeter, is having some trouble with its
database systems. They are hard to scale and slowing down the application.

The lead developer has asked you to look into the possibility of migrating some
of their data storage over to NoSQL data solutions. They've provided some sample
data from the current solutions, and it's your job to:

- extract the data from the source (this might be SQL, CSV or plaintext)

- transform so that it can be added to a NoSQL database

- load it into the NoSQL database, then do some testing to demonstrate how it
  works
